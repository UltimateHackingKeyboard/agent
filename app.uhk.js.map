It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own\n * animation within the animation sequence.\n *\n * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation\n * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order\n * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements\n * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.\n *\n * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation\n * triggers that will execute at the same time.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"exp =! exp\">Toggle</button>\n * <hr>\n *\n * <div [\\@parentAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *   <header>Hello</header>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       one\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       two\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       three\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate\n * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations\n * can also fire:\n *\n * ```ts\n * // parent-child.component.ts\n * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'parent-child-component',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('parentAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         query('header', [\n *           style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *         ]),\n *         query('\\@childAnimation', [\n *           animateChild()\n *         ])\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     trigger('childAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ParentChildCmp {\n *   exp: boolean = false;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to\n * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the\n * `\\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.\n *\n * This example can be further extended by using stagger:\n *\n * ```ts\n * query('\\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [\n *   animateChild()\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.\n *\n * ## The first frame of child animations\n * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the\n * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way\n * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the\n * sub animations kick off.\n *\n * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition\n * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`\n * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\\@childAnimation` is queried and called\n * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.\n *\n * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\\@link query query()} and it will only work\n * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes\n * and transitions are not handled by this API).\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animateChild(options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 9 /* AnimateChild */, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `useAnimation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

If a query\n * has the `optional` flag set to true then this error will be ignored.\n *\n * ```js\n * query('.some-element-that-may-not-be-there', [\n *   animate(...),\n *   animate(...)\n * ], { optional: true })\n * ```\n *\n * ### Special Selector Values\n *\n * The selector value within a query can collect elements that contain angular-specific\n * characteristics\n * using special pseudo-selectors tokens.\n *\n * These include:\n *\n *  - Querying for newly inserted/removed elements using `query(\":enter\")`/`query(\":leave\")`\n *  - Querying all currently animating elements using `query(\":animating\")`\n *  - Querying elements that contain an animation trigger using `query(\"\\@triggerName\")`\n *  - Querying all elements that contain an animation triggers using `query(\"\\@*\")`\n *  - Including the current element into the animation sequence using `query(\":self\")`\n *\n *\n *  Each of these pseudo-selector tokens can be merged together into a combined query selector\n * string:\n *\n *  ```\n *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, \\@subTrigger', [...])\n *  ```\n *\n * ### Demo\n *\n * ```\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'inner',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [\\@queryAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       <h1>Title</h1>\n *       <div class=\"content\">\n *         Blah blah blah\n *       </div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *    trigger('queryAnimation', [\n *      transition('* => goAnimate', [\n *        // hide the inner elements\n *        query('h1', style({ opacity: 0 })),\n *        query('.content', style({ opacity: 0 })),\n *\n *        // animate the inner elements in, one by one\n *        query('h1', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),\n *        query('.content', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),\n *      ])\n *    ])\n *  ]\n * })\n * class Cmp {\n *   exp = '';\n *\n *   goAnimate() {\n *     this.exp = 'goAnimate';\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} selector\n * @param {?} animation\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction query(selector, animation, options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 11 /* Query */, selector: selector, animation: animation, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `stagger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. It is designed to be used inside of an animation {\\@link query query()}\n * and works by issuing a timing gap between after each queried item is animated.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * In the example below there is a container element that wraps a list of items stamped out\n * by an ngFor. The container element contains an animation trigger that will later be set\n * to query for each of the inner items.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- list.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"toggle()\">Show / Hide Items</button>\n * <hr />\n * <div [\\@listAnimation]=\"items.length\">\n *   <div *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\n *     {{ item }}\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * The component code for this looks as such:\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {trigger, transition, style, animate, query, stagger} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({\n *   templateUrl: 'list.component.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('listAnimation', [\n *        //...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ListComponent {\n *   items = [];\n *\n *   showItems() {\n *     this.items = [0,1,2,3,4];\n *   }\n *\n *   hideItems() {\n *     this.items = [];\n *   }\n *\n *   toggle() {\n *     this.items.length ? this.hideItems() : this.showItems();\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * And now for the animation trigger code:\n *\n * ```ts\n * trigger('listAnimation', [\n *   transition('* => *', [ // each time the binding value changes\n *     query(':leave', [\n *       stagger(100, [\n *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 0 }))\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     query(':enter', [\n *       style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *       stagger(100, [\n *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ])\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * Now each time the items are added/removed then either the opacity\n * fade-in animation will run or each removed item will be faded out.\n * When either of these animations occur then a stagger effect will be\n * applied after each item's animation is started.\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timings\n * @param {?} animation\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction stagger(timings, animation) {\n    return { type: 12 /* Stagger */, timings: timings, animation: animation };\n}\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) {\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\n  }\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.
