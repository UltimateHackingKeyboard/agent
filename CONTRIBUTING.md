# Bug reports

If the build process fails, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/agent/issues/new) containing the complete build log.

If the build process succeeds but Agent fails at runtime, it's most likely due to a JavaScript error. In this case, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/agent/issues/new) containing the error displayed by the JavaScript console.
